🧠 Project Overview
---------------------

This project aims to forecast future sales based on historical sales data using time series modeling techniques.
By analyzing sales trends, seasonality, and patterns, the model helps businesses make data-driven decisions regarding inventory management, 
marketing strategy, and revenue planning.

🎯 Objective
-------------------

Predict future product sales using past data.
Identify seasonal trends and demand patterns.
Provide actionable insights to improve sales planning and performance.

🧰 Tech Stack & Libraries
---------------------------

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries Used:
--------------
pandas, numpy → Data processing
matplotlib, seaborn → Data visualization
statsmodels, pmdarima, or prophet → Time-series modeling
scikit-learn → Evaluation metrics
joblib → Model saving/loading

📂 Dataset
-------------

Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)

Columns Example:

Date — Date of sale
Item_ID — Product identifier
Sales — Total sales for that date

The dataset was cleaned, aggregated by date, and transformed into a time-series format for model training.

⚙️ Project Workflow
---------------------

Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Converting Date column to datetime format
Aggregating daily/weekly/monthly sales
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trend, seasonality, and decomposition plots
Correlation and rolling averages
Model Building
Models used: Prophet and Xgboost
Train-test split on time basis
Model tuning and residual analysis
Forecasting
Predicting sales for next n days
Visualizing forecast vs actuals
Evaluation
Metrics: RMSE, MAE

📊 Results
--------------
The predictions closely followed actual sales trends, especially during seasonal peaks.

Below is a sample forecast visualization:

💡 Insights
-------------

Peak sales were observed during holiday season.
Certain products/stores show strong seasonal demand.
The model can be integrated into dashboards for continuous forecasting.

🚀 Future Scope
-----------------

Integrate Prophet or LSTM models for multi-step forecasting.
Deploy the model using Streamlit or Flask for real-time prediction.
Automate data updates via scheduled scripts or APIs.
